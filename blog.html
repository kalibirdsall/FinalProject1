               <h2>Understanding the Science of Reading</h2>
               <p>If you've been following education news lately, you've probably encountered the term "science of reading." This phrase appears in headlines, school board meetings, and policy debates across the country. But what does it actually mean, and why should parents care?</p>
               <p>The science of reading refers to decades of research from cognitive scientists, neuroscientists, and education researchers about how the human brain learns to read. Unlike learning to speak, which humans do naturally, reading is not innate. Our brains must be explicitly taught to connect letters with sounds and blend those sounds into words. This research has identified specific, evidence-based methods that work best for teaching children to read.</p>
               <p>At the heart of science of reading instruction is systematic phonics. This approach teaches children the relationship between letters and sounds in a structured, sequential way. Students learn to decode words by sounding them out rather than guessing based on pictures or context clues. The research shows this method works for the vast majority of students, including those with dyslexia and other reading challenges.</p>
               <p>For years, many schools used approaches that emphasized memorization and guessing strategies over phonics. These methods, though well-intentioned, contradicted what research showed about how children actually learn to read. The results were troubling. Millions of children struggled unnecessarily, and reading achievement stagnated.</p>
               <p>Now, states and districts nationwide are shifting back to science-based reading instruction. The articles you see on this page reflect this major educational transformation. When you read about new reading laws, curriculum changes, or improved test scores, you're seeing the science of reading in action.</p>
               <p>Understanding these terms helps you advocate for your child. You can ask informed questions about your school's reading curriculum, recognize effective instruction when you see it, and support policies that give all children the tools they need to become confident, capable readers.</p>
