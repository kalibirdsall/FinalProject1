               <h2>Our Founding Story</h2>
               <p>We created Phonics Link because we believe every child deserves the gift of reading. In today's digital world, parents often feel overwhelmed trying to find trustworthy resources to help their children learn. There's so much conflicting information out there about the "right" way to teach reading, and it's hard to know where to start.</p>
               <p>We wanted to create a simple, welcoming space where parents could find evidence-based resources without the confusion. Whether you're looking for book recommendations, interactive games to practice letter recognition, or information about current developments in reading education, everything here is designed with one goal in mind: supporting you as you support your young reader.</p>
               <p>Reading opens doors to learning, imagination, and opportunity. By giving parents access to quality tools and information, we hope to help more children discover the joy and power of reading. Your involvement in your child's literacy journey makes all the difference, and we're here to help you every step of the way.</p>
               <p>Kali and Anika had to make an educational website for their Information Technologies course at Pratt Institute. After a few minutes of brainstorming, and A LOT OF TIME making this website, Phonics Link was born!</p>
